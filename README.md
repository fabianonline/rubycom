Rubycom
=======

Rubycom is a webcomic downloader and viewer application, just like dailystrips.
It's written in RubyOnRails and, um... it's great.

It started as a personal project, but perhaps someone wants to use (or even contribute) to it...


Installation
------------

1. You need a normal RoR enabled webserver.
2. Clone rubycom.
3. Modify `config/database.yml`.
4. Modify `config/config.yml`.
5. Run `rake db:migrate`.
6. Make sure the webserver has the right to write into `public/comics`.
7. Call rubycom in your webbrowser.
8. Have fun?
