This folder contains single comic strip definitions.
These definitions can be created by rake comics:dump.

These files will never be used by rubycom.
In order to make them useable, they have to be merged into config/comics.yml.

If you are the maintainer of this project: Use rake comics:merge to do this.
If you are not the maintainer of this project: Commit your new definitions ans send me a pull request.
